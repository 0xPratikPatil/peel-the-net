## 📦 TorLens — Real-time Tor network monitoring and node data library for Node.js


**[TorLens](https://github.com/0xpratikpatil/torlens)** is our companion Node.js library built for developers who want direct access to Tor relay metadata in their own applications.

With TorLens, you can:

- 🔍 Query nodes by IP, fingerprint, or host
- 📥 Fetch live relay data
- 🛠 Integrate Tor network intelligence into custom tools, scripts, or dashboards
- 📚 Use as a backend module for monitoring or OSINT purposes

TorLens makes working with the Tor network programmatically easy, clean, and scalable.
